A Maxima package to efficiently compute a basis of the subspace of hypergeometric term solutions of any holonomic recurrence equation. Recurrence equations with rational coefficients are also considered.

The file HyperTermHoloRE.mac is the package (source code);

The file HyperTermHoloRE.dem is a demo file;

The file HyperTermHoloRE.texi is the texinfo source code of the package;

The file HyperTermHoloRE.pdf is the pdf documentation obtained from HyperTermHoloRE.texi;

The file test_HyperTermHoloRE.mac is a Maxima test file of the package;

The file testREs.mac is a file of some recurrence equations used in test_HyperTermHoloRE.mac.
